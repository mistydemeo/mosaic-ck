2.7ck9
------
(*) = alternative renderer only

System:
 o Improved progressive rendering. Images now load asynchronously when the
   progressive renderer is on (the default).
 o Shell app for Mac OS X launches X11, gives you a dock icon, and allows
   Tab switching. The Xcode project is in motifmaclauncher/ for 10.4+.
 o Clicking the Mosaic icon now causes an unconditional stop. Previously,
   it could hang if the initial start page was not answering.
 o Made most file storage relative to $HOME/.mosaic, and added a symlink
   automatically for ~/Library/Mosaic-CK on Mac OS X systems (these will
   be created automatically for you if they do not exist). You will need
   to move your hotlist, annotations and other files there if you are using
   one. They no longer start with a dot (e.g., move
   ~/.mosaic-personal-annotations to ~/.mosaic/mosaic-personal-annotations).
   
   NB: The only files in $HOME are .mime.types, .mailcap and .newsrc, and
   .mosaicpid (for compatibility).

 o Preferences are now saved (to ~/.mosaic/mosaic-preferences, natch). However
   NCSA never finished it, and so this support is incomplete. Many of the
   exposed preferences do work, but some don't. Gradual improvements to come.
 o URL bar and text gadgets use a slightly smaller font for more space.

Renderer:
 o Elements can now be arbitrarily formatted horizontally. This is now
   exploited with support for left, right and center alignment, and table
   cells when "mapped" as paragraphs also work the same. Changes made to
   <p>, <td>, <?l>. (*)
 o Expanded ampersand escape and UTF-8 space with additional entities. (*)
 o Initial support for Windows-1252. (*)
 o <notables> support. (*)

2.7ck8
------
 o Initial progressive rendering support (default: "Progressive Rendering")
 o Alternative renderer support (default: old rendering style available
		with "Use Classic Renderer"). This will be where rendering
		improvements go in order to preserve the app as a historical
		recreation as well.
	o initial UTF-8 and Unicode translation support
	o <div></div>, <td></td> now seen as block elements
	o <script> and <style> now only ignored under alternative renderer
	o <?xml ...> now properly ignored
 o More HTML entities (in both classic and alternative renderer for efficiency)
 o Linux support restored, thanks to Jeroen Schot (.linux)
 o Old Linux support moved to .linux1
 o Optimization enabled for .osx, .uosx, .ppcmt
 o Source code cleanup

2.7ck7
------
 o Mac OS X support (.osx, .uosx)
 o <script>, <style> aware
 o Multiple improvements to Gopher core, including hURLs and itypes i & 3
 o Multiple security fixes to Gopher core
 o http_proxy correctly understood with slash at end or not
 o View Images Internally now default

2.7ck6
------
 o New version number
 o Makefile.ppcmt
 o Character set ignored in MIME types
 o Patches added for newer LIBPNGs
 o Default URL changed

From 2.5 to 2.6
...............

 o Inline JPEGs are supported. 
 o mailto URLs are supported. 
 o Improved Usenet support, including threaded newsgroup listings and article
   posting. 
 o Common Client Interface now supports POST to server, SEND
   BROWSERVIEW and QUIT browser protocol functionality. 
 o PostScript printing and saving optionally includes URL and page number as
   page header. 
 o Minimal group annotation support. Set the annotationServer resource
   to the URL of your CGI annotation server. 
 o The URL text field is now editable. Pressing Enter within the text field
   causes Mosaic to open the displayed URL. 
 o Load to local disk can now be activated on a one-time basis by holding down
   the shift key while clicking on a hyperlink. 
 o HTTP header Referer now contains a document's parent URL (for hyperlinks
   that are clicked-on with the mouse pointer, only). NCSA httpd 1.4 can log
   the Referer field. 
 o HTTP header User-Agent now uses a slightly different format, for
   consistency with other platforms: 
     User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.6 (X11; SunOS 4.1.3 sun4m)  libwww/2.12 modified
 o resource *maxNumCCIConnect added to restrict number of cci clients
   communicating with the browser. 
 o comment card for user survey introduced in this version. 
 o Added additional entity support 
 o On reload, added support for a cache proxy. If resource
   reloadPragmaNoCache is set, Mosaic will send an additional header notifying
   proxy not to use cache. 
 o Added support for older NNTP servers. 
 o Code has been Saber tested. 

From 2.4 to 2.5
...............

 o Added Common Client Interface (CCI) support.
 o Added X resource cciPort and command-line flag -cciPort.
 o Mosaic creates the file $HOME/.mosaiccciport listing the active
   CCI hostname and port number in the form host:port.
 o Added nested hotlists, with Copy, Insert, Up, Save, and Load options.
   (thanks to Gilles Bourhis).
 o Hotlists are now stored in HTML as nested unordered lists.
 o Binaries are now linked with the latest, greatest, HDF (Hierarchical
   Data Format) library. 
 o Added -kiosk command-line flag and Boolean X resource, kiosk.
 o Also added -kioskNoExit command-line flag and Boolean X
   resource kioskNoExit for kiosk mode without the close button.
 o Added defaultFontChoice X resource.
 o Added experimental editor hook to File menu.
 o Added editCommandUseXterm resource.
 o Added child signal handler. 
 o For security reasons, changed /bin/rm system calls to unlink().
 o Added limited HTML table support.
 o Added support for HTML <SUP>superscript</SUP> and <SUB>subscript
   </SUB> tags, allong with supSubFont X resource. 
 o Forms may now have multiple submit buttons by including a NAME
   attribute in INPUT elements of type SUBMIT.
 o Fixed comment parsing, so that HTML mark-up can exist inside
   comments. Comments should begin with <!-- and end with -->
 o Mosaic no longer displays text inside the <HEAD> section of an
   HTML document. 
 o Added <U>underline</U> support. 
 o Fixed case-sensitivity forms bug. 
 o Fixed some forms core dumps
 o More verbose error messages

From 2.3 to 2.4
...............

 o Fixed really embarassingly dumb bug that made widgets names appear
   next to toggle buttons on forms.

From 2.2 to 2.3
...............

 o Fixed security bug in telnet URLs.
 o Fixed bug with dithered images inverting on some displays.
 o Fixed bug with non-direct-WAIS clients core dumping on WAIS URLs.
 o Fixed bug with uninitialized gatewayed for proxy gateways.
 o Fixed memory overrun in PEM_AUTH code.
 o Fixed loss of small messages in PEM_AUTH code.
 o Fixed improper defaults for VerticalScrollOnRight.
 o Fixed more GIF decoding core dumps.
 o Fixed mispelling of XtSpecificationRelease in gui.c
 o Fixed 24bit handling bug that caused some displays to switch red and blue.
 o Added names to child widgets in forms.
 o Added autoconfiguration of MOTIF1_2 based on XmVERSION and XmREVISION.
 o Made dialogs rise to the top when selected a second time.
 o Added 24bit DirectColor support.
 o Added 16bit TrueColor support.
 o Changed dithering to Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
 o 2 color images go to black & white on monochrome, instead of dithering.
 o FORM now uses ENCTYPE and ENCENTITY to submit encrypted if PEM_AUTH
   defined.
 o New menu under "Options" to always request enrypted if PEM_AUTH defined.

From 2.1 to 2.2
...............

 o Fixed bug in unrecognized URLs that have whitespace at the beginning. 
 o Fixed bug with transparent color GIF89 images. 
 o Fixed more inlined image parsing code dumps. 
 o Fixed odd extra flashing in documents accessed after form documents. 
 o Fixed socket leak in interrupted I/O. 
 o Fixed bug in whitespace terminated entity '&' escapes. 
 o Added Frans Van Hoesel's latest postscript changes. 
 o Added Frans Van Hoesel's extra font support. 
 o Speedups in GIF decoding, thanks to David Koblas. 
 o Improved handling of monochrome displays. Detect mono without needing
   the -mono option, and dither inlined images. 
 o Added <OPTION VALUE=val> support so you can have the value returned
   different than the string displayed. 
 o Added <INPUT TYPE=hidden> to allow invisible constant name/value pairs
   to be added to submitted forms. 
 o Made resource verticalScrollOnRight user settable. 
 o Added hooks for PEM and PGP decoding by external application(s). 
 o Added support for proxy gateways, specifiable on a per access method basis. 

From 2.0 to 2.1
...............

 o Remote control users and script writers take note: control filename
   changed from /tmp/xmosaic.pid to /tmp/Mosaic.pid. This
   is the final such change, forever. 
 o Transparent uncompression over HTTP/1.0 is working -- Plexus
   3.0i-beta is known to handle the server-side aspects, and the first
   release of NCSA httpd after 1.0a5 will. Only content encodings
   "x-compress" and "x-gzip" are currently handled. 
 o Transparent uncompression for local files is now working. 
 o Mail sending from within Mosaic is redone. Notably: 
    o mailCommand resource is now totally obsolete. 
    o sendmailCommand resource is now expected to point to
      your system's sendmail binary; default is 
      /usr/lib/sendmail. Assumption is made that this
      program accepts command-line arguments specifying
      addresses to which message should be mailed, and accepts other
      headers and message text from stdin. 
    o Mailed messages are now MIME-compliant, including use of
      proper content-types. 
    o Additional header X-URL is used to indicate the URL of a
      mailed document to the recipient. 
    o A BASE directive is added to mailed HTML documents to
      allow inlined images and relative hyperlinks to work on the
      other end. 
 o Mosaic 1.2's multiline FTP response fixes (courtesy John
   Ockerbloom) merged in, and tweaks made. 
 o Added support for freeWAIS 0.202's URL type in native WAIS code. 
 o Added support for "204 NoResponse" responses in HTTP/1.0. When
   such a response is received, Mosaic will not go to a new document or
   an error message but will completely disregard the results of the
   connection. 
 o Status line now displays "xx of yy bytes" when talking to an HTTP/1.0
   server that tells it content-length. (For small transfers this may not
   happen, which is to be expected, as header and entire data block
   transfer will be very close together.) 
 o Worked around BadWindow crash under Ultrix with Edit Hotlist
   window. 
 o Worked around BadWindow crash under Ultrix with ISINDEX forms
   and text entry areas. 
 o Glitch with formatting long lines in some cases fixed. 
 o Fixed rare coredump opportunity in SELECT/OPTION handling. 
 o Fixed rare uninitialized memory read in widget selection code. 
 o Fixed another coredump opportunity in inlined image loading. 
 o Fixed coredump opportunity in client-side authentication code with
   long (>48 character) realm names. 
 o Mosaic no longer tries to pick up final reply from FTP servers, to
   thwart those servers that don't seem to be responding to the final reply
   read. Also should make FTP performance a little better. This may be
   an evil thing to do (since Mosaic may now tear down the socket before
   the FTP server has finished writing to it); I'm not sure. 
 o Rob says: "It appears on first glance that Mosaic 2.0 is ignoring
   anchors in redirected URLs." He was right, and it's now fixed. 
 o Made a few fixes in PostScript printing code: corrected header
   generation, and fixed width handling (thanks to Gustaf Neumann). 
 o Tweaked reloading code to avoid strange error message. 
 o Mosaic now assumes that text documents beginning with string
   "<BASE" or "<base" are HTML -- this makes it easy to use Mosaic
   as a metamail viewer for HTML documents mailed from this version
   of Mosaic. 
 o Merged in donated fixes for 6-bit and 16-bit displays. These aren't
   guaranteed to work as we have no way to test them. 
 o Fixed missing closing ADDRESS tag in news articles. 
 o Fixed condition in WAIS source parser that caused it to lose track of
   its state if escapted characters were inside quotes (thanks to Larry
   Masinter). 
 o Fixed FTP code to allow ftp://username:password@host/
   URLs (thanks to Larry Masinter). 
 o This version of Mosaic supports the GIF89 transparent color
   extension. You can create GIFs with a transparent background color
   with the latest beta of netpbm and its ppmtogif filter (you can
   FTP that from ftp.cs.ubc.ca in /ftp/archive/netpbm if
   you're desperate). 
 o Merged in SOCKS modifications from Ying-Da Lee
   (ylee@syl.dl.nec.com); for the version of SOCKS needed to compile
   with SOCKS support enabled, see here; note that SOCKS and the SOCKS
   code now in Mosaic are NOT supported by NCSA.
 o Fixed memory problem with trackFullURLs set to false (that
   option still doesn't work in all cases, but at least it does something
   reasonable now). 
 o Tweaks for compilation on various platforms. 

From 2.0 prerelease 8 to 2.0
............................

 o Fixed intermittent bug in loading files to disk (would inaccurately
   complain about insufficient temporary disk space). 
 o Extension map files can now have tabs as whitespace. 
 o Fixed more minor glitches in image caching, multiple windows, fun
   things like that. 
 o Never retry HTTP/1.0 POST operation as HTTP0 operation (makes no
   sense to do so). 
 o Removed really horrible compatibility hack for broken HTTP0 servers
   introduced in pre7 -- no longer useful, since ANU Bioinformatics has
   upgraded to HTTP/1.0. 
 o Tweaked remote control a little (fixed redisplay bugs on some servers). 
 o Tweaked HTTP/1.0 status messages. 
 o Tweaked bcopy/bzero macros for System V/Solaris. 

From 2.0 prerelease 7 to 2.0 prerelease 8
.........................................

 o Renamed executable 'Mosaic' and application class name 'Mosaic'. User
   X resources and system app defaults files should be updated as necessary. 
 o Implemented FORM METHOD="POST" with optional 
   ENCTYPE="application/x-www-form-urlencoded". 
 o Implemented TEXTAREA as described in the current (11/2) HTML+ spec. 
 o Fixed bugs with image caching (particularly with very small image cache
   sizes) and multiple open windows. 
 o Scrolled lists with nothing selected now return nothing. 
 o Fixed coredump opportunity in GUI part of authentication code (Marc's
   fault, not Ari's). 
 o Fixed glitch with spinning icon and deferred image loading. 
 o Quotes (") in OPTIONs now work. 
 o Radio buttons no longer allowed to be "none of many" (document writers
   should make one of the buttons checked by default -- if you think you
   want to allow "none of many" behavior, just throw in a "none of the
   above" radio button). 
 o Image input elements whose images are deferred no longer have a
   hyperlink available in the deferred image icon. 
 o Fixed glitch with exploding Gopher/FTP icons in some cases. 
 o Force allowShellResize to false on Mosaic shell windows to avoid some
   stupid window manager bugs. 
 o "I have noticed that Mosaic 2.0pre6 does not properly scroll horizontally
   when a preformatted <PRE> declared document is wider than the
   window." Also gopher://gopher.ora.com/00/ordering/online.ordering.
   Fixed! 
 o Fixed coredump opportunity when temporary directory (TMPDIR) is
   unusable. 
 o Fixed coredump opportunities when interrupting NNTP connects and
   reads and when including inlined images in news articles (yikes). 
 o Fixed bad PostScript output of documents with titles with embedded
   newlines. 
 o Fixed problems in PostScript code on DEC Alphas (hopefully). 
 o Fixed another coredump opportunity in GIF reading code. 
 o Fixed glitch in simplying URLs like 'http://blargh.blah.:8001/'. 
 o Password entry fields in forms now obey the MAXLENGTH attribute. 
 o Changed default DEC Ultrix and Alpha audio player to "aplay" (c.f.
   AudioFile). 
 o Tried to make handling of HTTP network writes more elegant, in case
   some HTTP0 server really confuses things. 
 o Additional performance optimizations in HTML widget. 
 o New colorful spinning globe icon. 
 o Final interface tweaks, according to the advice of our user interface and
   visual design expert. 
 o Fixed compilation glitches on a couple different platforms. 
 o A few miscellaneous minor cleanups. 

From 2.0 prerelease 6 to 2.0 prerelease 7
.........................................

 o Smart inlined image caching. Resource imageCacheSize can be
   set to the maximum image cache size of your choice (in kbytes;
   default 2048) -- command line option -ics also does this. 
    o All of the images in a given document will be (temporarily)
      cached while on that page regardless of the value of 
      imageCacheSize. (This is a feature :-). 
    o Cache flushes "least recently viewed". 
 o Added TYPE="image" to forms support (see testcase). 
 o Added interruptible reads. All data loads should now be completely
   interruptible (from end of DNS lookup to beginning of in-widget
   document formatting), except for certain stages of a direct WAIS
   query. 
 o Added "mosaic-internal-present" magic viewer to cause arbitrary
   MIME types to be presented to the user using Mosaic's normal
   plaintext display mechanism. Added many default mappings for
   things like troff and TeX documents to this magic viewer. 
 o Made additional fixes to HTTP code for very small inlined images
   -- testcases here and here. 
 o Transparent uncompression is back (but not recommended, for
   cross-platform compatibility). 
    o X resources uncompressCommand and 
      gunzipCommand still control uncompression commands. 
    o You should upgrade to gzip version 1.2.4 if you're not already
      there, as the new default for X resource gunzipCommand is
      "gunzip -n -f", which requires a recent version of gzip. 
    o Mosaic will not transparently uncompress anything coming
      across a HTTP/1.0 connection, under any circumstances, yet. 
    o Mosaic will not transparently uncompress anything
      transferred in binary transfer mode, but will transparently
      uncompress files typed such that they get saved directly to
      disk (e.g. application/octet-stream, and any
      MIME type mapped to magic viewer
      "mosaic-internal-dump"). 
 o Partially removed smart FTP interface -- will be restored at some
   point in the future when I have more time to work on it. In the
   meantime, it caused too many problems with too many servers. 
 o Added "Reload Images" menu option to explicitly flush images on
   current page and reload the entire thing. 
 o Added horrible hack to allow (slow, but working) transactions with
   way-old HTTP0 servers. 
 o Made handling of screwed-up HTTP/1.0 MIME header sets more
   robust. 
 o Proper password entry dialog for authentication support. 
 o Added last resolved host info caching to help performance with slow,
   confused, or misconfigured DNS servers. 
 o Most temporary files weren't going into specified TMPDIR -- fixed. 
 o Fixed bug in handling of Gopher titles with 8-bit characters (testcase 
   here -- this image). 
 o Fixed bugs in issuing Gopher queries -- punctuation in queries, etc.
   should work now. 
 o Better handling if temporary disk space runs out (still not a good
   thing to allow to happen, though). 
 o Better socket handling (sockets should always be closed by the time
   an external viewer is started now, so they don't leak until the viewer
   exits). 
 o Fixed bug in handling HTTP/1.0 redirection for inlined images and
   reloading. 
 o Fixed bug in following symlinks to absolutely specified files on FTP
   servers. 
 o Fixed minor and intermittent scrollbar management bug. 
 o Fixed another coredump opportunity in GIF reading code. 
 o Fixed another coredump opportunity in FTP icon code (testcase
   file://ftp.uwp.edu/pub/music/lyrics/b/beatles -- can't read it because
   the FTP server is highly nonstandard, but at least now it doesn't dump
   core). 
 o Fixed coredump opportunity in mailcap-parsing code. 
 o Fixed handling of some Gopher directories (e.g. 
   gopher://calypso.oit.unc.edu/11/sunsite.d). 
 o Fixed coredump when using HREF instead of SRC with IMG. 
 o Color stuff -- start at http://nearnet.gnn.com/mkt/mkt.intro.html
   with correct colors and middle-button the resource directory, close
   new window, repeat as necessary, occasionally pressing 'R' (refresh)
   in the original window -- you'll see the colors in the newly opened
   window look incorrect (in 1.2 also). Fixed! 
 o Fixed interruptible I/O weirdness on some System V systems. 
 o Cleaned up generation of Gopher titles. 
 o Changed default player for all audio files from showaudio to sfplay
   for SGIs to avoid various problems. 
 o Problem in SELECT's coming over Gopher -- %0D's at end of lines
   don't get clipped out -- testcase 
   gopher://gopher.saintjoe.edu/0/search/archieplex.html -- fixed. 
 o Fixed glitch with PostScript code. 
 o Made small change to FTP code to cooperate with various FTP
   servers better (testcase here). 
 o Fixed coredump when pressing Reset button in form with password
   entry field. 
 o Fixed socket leaking problems in FTP, WAIS, and beyond -- sockets
   should never again be leaked by Mosaic; if you can confirm this is
   happening, please let us know (and provide evidence, testcase
   sequences, and netstat readouts). 
 o Added recognition of Gopher+ image, sound, and movie types --
   still no guarantee they'll be handled properly, as Gopher+ does typing
   a little differently and we don't provide full support for Gopher+
   anyway. 
 o Fixed problem if temporary local copy of HDF file goes away
   unexpectedly. Also better handling of temporary local files -- 
   however, beware that if you use Mosaic's HDF viewing support, you
   should clean up your temporary directory space on a fairly regular
   basis, as Mosaic does not always know when to clean it up for you
   (for various reasons -- Mosaic should always clean up local copies of
   other types of data files though). 
 o Fixed longstanding security glitch in Gopher support (Marc VH will
   recognize this). 
 o News support tweaked. 
 o More performance enhancements -- go Quantify! 
 o Added some portability fixes. 
 o Lots of little cleanups and fixes. 

From 2.0 prerelease 5 to 2.0 prerelease 6
.........................................

 o Added CERN authentication code with GUI support (see CERN docs and 
   testcases). 
 o Added/revised scrolled lists, option menus, multiline text areas support in
   fill-out forms; see docs. 
 o Added local directory icons and enhanced FTP icons (thanks to Charles
   Henrich). 
 o New toggle button for selecting delayed image loading on the fly. 
 o New "Load Images In Current" menu option to load all (delayed) images
   in current document. 
 o Improved handling of wide range of HTTP/1.0 response codes (see BSDI
   testcases). 
 o Fixed really stupid problem with networking -- numeric addresses were
   being handled incorrectly. 
 o Fixed coredump when reloading initial document that had been interrupted
   first time it was being loaded; also added internal fixes to make doing
   things with no document loaded at least not crash the program. 
 o Fixed bug when retrieving ftp://mailbase.ac.uk/pub/lists-k-o/nir (it's not
   accessible but a spurious bug report was getting dumped to stderr). 
 o Made FTP directory handling more flexible/accurate (testcase here --
   should see "lists" directory). 
 o Handle HTTP0/HTTP1 socket-level protocol clash a little better (e.g. 
   http://sunsite.unc.edu:8988/expo/nobeamup_map.html?49,51 -- might not
   be a valid testcase anymore). 
 o Binary transfer bug fixed -- it works right now. 
 o Transparent uncompression still doesn't work (sorry), but the mutant
   compressed filename munging code that was alive in pre5 is disabled now,
   and compressed files are treated as binary. 
 o Worked around strange Motif bug causing crashes on some platforms with
   message about accelerators. 
 o Now properly recognize comments ('#' first character in line) in extension
   maps. 
 o Fixed problem with encoding of 8-bit characters in fill-out forms and
   elsewhere. 
 o Made MIME type handling case insensitive in HTTP and WAIS code. 
 o Enhanced URL canonicalization (safe handling of trailing period in fully
   qualified hostnames, plus lowercasing of all hostnames). 
 o Cleaned up some big direct WAIS and other memory leaks. 
 o Improved handling of Gopher errors. 
 o Improved handling of binary transfer mode (now "Load To Local Disk")
   -- local tmp file properly removed when cancel button is hit, and dialog
   box is now modal to prevent problems. 
 o Fixed bug in delayed inlined image icon handling with multiple delayed
   inlined images on the same line. 
 o Gopher/FTP icons are now part of anchors, so they can be clicked on (even
   though they're normal color -- trust us on this one). 
 o Fixed memory corruption problem with remote control newwin
   directive. 
 o Changed FTP client code to always pass fully qualified machine name in
   anonymous password whenever possible (actual username is already being
   passed). 
 o Cleaned up menubar. 
 o Lots of little cleanups, performance tweaks, and portability fixes. 

From 2.0 prerelease 4 to 2.0 prerelease 5
.........................................

 o Added INPUT elements of type RADIO for fill-out forms as per
   HTML+ spec. 
 o Added INPUT elements of type PASSWORD for fill-out forms as per
   HTML+ spec. 
 o Added INPUT elements of type OPTION for option menus in fill-out
   forms (not in HTML+ spec yet). 
 o Added resource twirlingTransferIcon, default true, can be set to false to
   turn off twirling NCSA logo on transfers (interruption is still possible). 
 o Added resource twirlIncrement, default 4096, to indicate how many bytes
   (minimum) are transferred between icon twirls in interface for normal
   (FTP, Gopher, HTTP) transfers, if twirlingTransferIcon is on. 
 o FTP interface now has icons, byte counts (courtesy Charles Henrich). 
 o Gopher icons are back. 
 o Gopher type handling is back up to par, including support for
   tweakGopherTypes. 
 o Brought default mailcap and extension mapping stuff up to speed;
   enumerated previously wildcarded types (image/*, audio/*) for
   debatably broken CERN server. 
 o External viewers need not have "%s" as part of their names anymore; if
   they don't, then the data will be piped through stdin when they are
   executed. 
 o Added "Reload Config Files" menubar entry, to cause mailcaps and
   extension maps to be reloaded on the fly. 
 o Multiformat WAIS support is now working; testcase here; sample query. 
 o MIME types returned from WAIS servers are now handled correctly. 
 o Telnet/rlogin/tn3270 works again. 
 o Upon startup, now writes own pid into ~/.mosaicpid. 
 o Clip anchor ("#...") off of current URL, if present, before doing search,
   for both forms and isindex. 
 o Widget creation now deferred as long as possible, to eliminate ugliness of
   index field, etc. showing up too early. 
 o It should now be impossible to do anything interface-wise during a
   transfer except click on the interrupt button for the current window. 
 o Fixed memory problem introduced in pre4 triggered when opening a new
   window with middle mouse click. 
 o Fixed HTML widget crash condition that hit HP-UX. 
 o Fixed problem jumping to anchors in the same document (jump to "#a" in
   a document, the "#b", then go back and you were still at "#b" instead of
   "#a"). Also nailed down jumping back and forth between anchors in
   general. Performance maybe could be better. 
 o Handle 403 return codes better ("Forbidden"). 
 o Fixed problem with icon not righting itself after reloading inlined images
   (testcase). 
 o Fixed problem with invalid content-type returned as part of HTTP/1.0
   reply (was causing bad memory corruption; now unrecognized
   content-types default to HTML). Testcase -- click on "Help". 
 o Fixed problem introduced in pre4 with confused history mechanism and
   internal anchors. 
 o Fixed minor problem with news formatting. 
 o Ignore SIGPIPE; error EPIPE is also considered to be a sign of the
   HTTP1/0 protocol incompatibility problem. 
 o Fixed problem with -dil and images that aren't accessible at all. 
 o Merged in useful fixes from 2.11, including ignoring of ":80" for HTTP
   URLs and ":70" for Gopher URLs in URL parsing for improved history
   tracking. 
 o Killed use of const structs in HTML-PSformat.c to make compilation
   under Ultrix easier. 
 o Added patches for Esix 4.0.4 and Solaris x86 2.1. 
 o Reported bug: "Found a bug with the maxlength parm, if you set a size to
   something other than the specified maxlength, it will allow data of any
   length to be entered" fixed. 
 o Cleaned up communication notification mechanisms. 

From 2.0 prerelease 3 to 2.0 prerelease 4
.........................................

 o Prerelease startup page is now hardwired to a warning page about the
   hazards of prereleases, to keep users from having the slightest thought
   that a prerelease is the same thing as a stable release and should be
   given to small children, normal users, or people without senses of
   humor. 
 o Basic interruptible I/O. 
    o You can interrupt in the middle of a connect or between reads
      of chunks of data during HTTP, Gopher, direct WAIS, and FTP
      connections. 
    o Existing problems: can't interrupt DNS (hostname) lookups,
      can't interrupt in the middle of reads. 
 o Added support for NCSA httpd 1.0 style extension/content-type config
   files (extension maps). 
    o Resource useDefaultExtensionMap, default true, can be
      set to false to keep Mosaic from having any default extension
      mappings. We strongly recommend that this resource be left
      true; simply override as necessary. 
    o Resource globalExtensionMap, default
      "/usr/local/lib/mosaic/mime.types", can be set to the location of
      the system-wide extension map config file of your choice. 
    o Resource personalExtensionMap, default
      ".mime.types", can be set to the location of the personal
      extension map config file of your choice -- the value of the
      environment variable HOME is prepended to this. 
    o Extension matching is now case insensitive (e.g., .txt and 
      .TXT are always treated the same). 
 o Added support for RFC 1343-style mailcap files to map MIME types
   to external viewers. Together with the extension map support (above),
   this provides complete customizability of viewers, supported types, and
   extensions in a manner smoothly compatible with multimedia mail. 
    o Resource useDefaultTypeMap, default true, can be set to
      false to keep Mosaic from having any default type mappings. 
      We strongly recommend that this resource be left true; simply
      override as necessary. 
    o Resource globalTypeMap, default
      "/usr/local/lib/mosaic/mailcap", can be set to the location of the
      system-wide mailcap (type map config) file of your choice. 
    o Resource personalTypeMap, default ".mailcap", can be set
      to the location of the personal mailcap file of your choice --
      the value of the environment variable HOME is prepended to
      this. 
    o In this prerelease, we are not RFC 1343-compliant in a couple
      respects: a "%s" must be included in the viewer specification; if
      it is not, Mosaic will not currently feed the data to the viewer
      via stdin. Also, "%t" and "%{" are not recognized. Also, things
      like copiousoutput, test, and needsterminal aren't
      recognized either. We don't know if these things are important
      or not (needsterminal probably is but the others probably
      aren't). 
    o There are two "magic viewers" that can be associated with
      particular MIME types: 
       o mosaic-internal-dump is used to tell Mosaic to
         dump files of the corresponding type to disk (providing
         the user with a dialog box to specify a filename).
         Normally this "magic viewer" applies to all
         unrecognized types (including, by default, 
         application/octet-stream). 
       o mosaic-internal-reference is used to tell
         Mosaic that it has native handling capabilities for this
         datatype. This should only be used for HDF and
         netCDF data files, and only with versions of Mosaic
         that have native HDF support compiled in. By default
         this "magic viewer" applies to types 
         application/x-hdf, 
         application/x-netcdf, application/hdf,
         and application/netcdf (the latter two aren't
         valid MIME types at the moment, but should be
         someday). 
 o Added better WAIS type support. In particular, given an arbitrary
   WAIS type (e.g. "TEXT", "WSRC", "GIF"), the following occurs: 
     1 If a MIME type of the same name is found, then that is the type.
      (This is looking forward to the days when WAIS servers will
      return MIME types -- "image/gif" instead of "GIF", etc.) 
     2 Otherwise, a dummy filename "foo.type" is constructed (e.g.
      "foo.GIF") and run through the normal extension mapping code
      to try to do a MIME type match. This means that you can
      expand the WAIS types Mosaic handles simply by adding
      entries to your extension map (and, if necessary, your mailcap). 
     3 If this fails, we assume plaintext. 
 o Fixed "bad docid" problem with direct WAIS queries to some WAIS
   servers (including White House Papers). (I'm still not sure this is
   bulletproof -- please send bug reports regarding bad or missing docids
   or documents, inconsistent results, etc.) 
 o Added support for 300-level HTTP/1.0 replies (301 and 302 --
   redirection or forwarding of URLs). 

   In conjunction with NCSA httpd 1.0a2 and later, this means graphical
   overviews of distributed information spaces are now easily doable (a
   single image map can essentially point to lots of URLs scattered all
   across the Web). An example is here. 
 o Added support for <BASE HREF="whatever"> to allow
   specification of a "real" URL inside an HTML document. (This is a
   convenient way to have WAIS server access not screw up URLs of
   documents that normally exist in a hypermedia hierarchy, or in any
   other instance where the same document, especially when containing
   relative links, is served off of more than one server.) 

   An example is here -- the document is physically located at
   "http://wintermute.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/foobar.html" but the "real" URL
   is specified in the document source. Inlined links specified with
   relative URLs, and relative hyperlinks, work. 
 o Deferred inline image loading -- resource delayImageLoads can
   be set to true (or command-line flag -dil) to cause inlined images to
   not be loaded by default. 
    o Instead, a little icon is inlined that can be clicked on to have the
      image loaded and expanded in place. 
    o Images serving as anchors get a little arrow icon on top of the
      little image icon that can be clicked on to follow the anchor. 
    o Only problem remaining: how to handle ISMAP images
      reasonably in this context. 
 o Reworked HTML widget layout to support consistent baselines --
   typography is much improved. This also means: 
    o <IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE> is now supported. 
    o Input elements in fill-out forms are now better aligned with
      their surroundings -- baseline of text in text widget is aligned
      with baseline of surrounding text line; toggle buttons are placed
      correctly. 
 o Papered over basic incompatibility between HTTP0 and HTTP/1.0
   protocols -- sockets can get confused when sending a HTTP/1.0
   request to a HTTP0 server; we now detect when this happens and
   reissue the request as HTTP0. This is not a really good fix, as there is a
   performance hit if it must be done frequently and it's ugly besides, but
   it does mean that data should never be lost when talking to a HTTP0
   server. 
 o Fixed compatibility problem with X11R5/Motif 1.2 (the binaries we
   distribute are still linked with X11R4/Motif 1.1 but you should be able
   to compile and run with X11R5/Motif 1.2 now). 
 o New and improved inlined XPM3 support. 
 o Fixed fairly large memory problem dealing with external data elements
   in HTFWriter.c, which often instantiated itself in coredumps in the
   GIF reading/decompressing code. 
 o Fixed really stupid problem interpreting binary data over HTTP/1.0
   connections. 
 o Fixed coredump on File->Mail To with no specified subject. 
 o Fixed coredump on "Save As" under some circumstances with new
   HTML widget. 
 o Fixed coredump on getting back NULL text on first connection or on
   reload. 
 o Fixed stupid bug-like feature in HDF code regarding display of only
   value of a single-value vdata. 
 o Now sends DTM disconnect message when closing application, if
   DTM connection is active. 
 o Took out extra space after periods bug-like feature. 
 o Fixed bug with new widget: document sometimes getting shoved off
   top of window and no scrollbar appearing. 
 o Binary transfer mode is back, and unknown types are handled as with
   binary transfer mode. 
 o Fixed problem with trailing slash on FTP directory (old problem, once
   fixed, reintroduced in 2.0). 
 o Fixed lots of memory leaks (thanks to Purify). 
 o Changed default documentsMenuSpecfile to
   /usr/local/lib/mosaic/documents.menu. 

From 2.0 prerelease 2 to 2.0 prerelease 3
.........................................

 o Libwww2 merged in (based on libwww-2.09a; heavily modified).  
    o Basic HTTP/1.0 support, including MIME format
      comprehension.  (See libwww-2.09/HTInit.c; no run-time
      customization is in place yet.) 
    o Direct WAIS support.  
       o Link to freeWAIS 0.1 client libraries.  
       o Handle plaintext, html, binary formats (!) cleanly.  
       o Even access HDF/netCDF files out of a WAIS database
         and have them be handled properly by Mosaic (parsed and
         displayed with inlined images, hyperlinks, and the works
         as usual).  
       o New resource maxWaisResponses controls maximum
         number of matches you get from a WAIS server; default
         is 200.  
    o FTP and file interfaces now alphabetize filenames.  
    o Local file interface inlines README file in directory listing, if
      one exists.  
    o "ftp" URL always forces FTP link -- never tries local directory.
      "file" URL still first tries local directory then tries FTP link.  
    o Search suffix now cropped from URL before determining file
      type by extension.  
    o Lots of new bugs, and lots of previously fixed bugs from Mosaic
      1.x reincarnated as new bugs.  
 o New and improved HTML widget.  
    o No more document pages or large virtual windows -- everything
      is managed by the widget itself (including scrollbars).  
    o Preformatted text sections wider than window do not force all
      text to be formatted to full width of window; text will be
      formatted to width of visible window and horizontal scrollbar
      will allow viewing remainder of the pre sections.  
    o Jumping to anchor in document in new window (e.g.  using
      middle button) now works.  
    o Performance performance performance!  (Really!) 
    o Scrolling up or down by pages now gives you a leftover line
      from the previous page.  
    o Added <br> and <hr> tags (linebreak and horizontal rule,
      respectively); also now support <strike> for strikeout effect.  
    o Initial fill-out form support.  This is a partial implementation of
      HTML+'s fill-out form spec, with a few minor changes.  
       o For information on what's supported, how it works, and
         examples, see here.  
       o A partially or fully filled out form will retain its state if
         you move to another document and then back.  
       o ISINDEX is now handled via an inlined fill-out form
         (which means searchIndexInDialog resource is no longer
         useful).  
 o New directives and features for remote control: 
    o "pagedown", "pageup", "scrolldown", and "scrollup" directives
      for remote control of scrollbar.  
    o Audio, video, and other external datatypes can now be accessed
      without the window going out to lunch.  
 o Status area of document view window now gives byte count during
   network transfer, etc.  (This isn't complete yet.) 
 o New resource trackFullURLs, if set to False, enables prototypical smart
   display of "where you're going" during mouse tracking, including format
   divination.  This is still in progress...  
 o Unflagged command-line arg specifies startup document, which is now
   different from home document.  
 o Normal ISINDEX queries are now escaped properly.  
 o ACTION attribute now accepted for ISINDEX tag; allows specification
   of alternate search engine.  
 o New File->Refresh menu entry (to cause image colors to be restored,
   etc.  without requiring network transfer) -- keyboard hotkey capital-R.  
 o Capital-H is now hotkey for calling up hotlist window.  
 o Fixed bug -- http://386bsd.cc.purdue.edu:8001/ was getting the machine
   name interpreted as numeric address.  
 o Nuked future list in history window.  
 o Nuked SIGINT interrupt hack.  
 o Nuked prototype group annotation support.  

From 2.0 prerelease 1 to 2.0 prerelease 2
.........................................

 o Added searchIndexInDialog resource.  If false (default), Search Index
   field (from 1.2) pops up on searchable pages and pops down on
   non-searchable pages.  If true, Search Index button (from 2.0
   prerelease 0/1) allows user to call up dialog box.  
 o The "Reload" option now clears out cached image data for the current
   document before reloading the document, thus causing the images to
   be reloaded also, if resource reloadReloadsImages is set to true
   (default is false).  
 o The "Clear Image Cache" menu option wipes out all cached images
   (reclaiming memory).  
 o "Clear Global History" also clears the image cache now.  
 o Fixed bug with internal bitmaps used in Gopher menus failing on
   non-8-bit displays.  
 o Ripped out Window Per Document option (middle button still causes
   new window to be opened on anchor activation).  
 o Toplevel Makefile (configure one file, type 'make', and you're done),
   as well as Makefile.sun, Makefile.ibm, Makefile.dec, Makefile.alpha
   for common configurations.  
 o Configurable Documents menu.  By default there isn't one.  Places to
   look in order of preference at program startup are the value of the
   resource documentsMenuSpecfile (by default
   /usr/local/mosaic/documents.menu), the value of the environment
   variable MOSAIC_DOCUMENTS_MENU_SPECFILE, and the
   value of the compile-time #define
   DOCUMENTS_MENU_SPECFILE (by default
   /usr/local/mosaic/documents.menu).  

   The specfile itself consists of alternating lines of title and URL; a
   single line starting with two dashes ("--") between any two title/URL
   pairs counts as a separator.  By default up to 80 things (title/URL pairs
   + separators) can be in a specfile; this can be increased in
   src/gui-menubar.c if you're crazy.  An example specfile is distributed
   with the source code (but is not intended to be a default).  

   The developer who implemented this feature disagrees with its
   presence in the program; the contents of such a customizable menubar
   ought to be in a hypermedia page (so you can actually format, lay out,
   and explain the various hyperlinks) that in turn ought to be served to
   the network (so others can benefit from your organization of
   information).  
 o Added simpleInterface resource to allow menubar and bottom button
   configuration to be considerably pared down (default is false).
   Comments on what should and shouldn't be in the simple user
   interface should be sent to cbushell@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  
 o Added "Network Starting Points" document pointer in Navigate menu
   (to make up for disappearance of Documents & Manuals menu); the
   URL is customizable at compile time (see src/mosaic.h).  
 o trackPointerMotion can now be set to false to inhibit pointer/URL
   tracking.  
 o Fixed yet another libwww bug -- coredump on malformed URL 
   gopher//mother.cs.bham.ac.uk:2070/.  

From 2.0 prerelease 0 to 2.0 prerelease 1
.........................................

 o Fixes for PostScript printing on non-SGI's and in general.  
 o Moved "Search Index" button to left side of window.  
 o Fixed problems keeping img.c from compiling without HDF support.  
 o Ripped out Documents, Manuals.  
 o Better Gopher icons (thanks, Kevin Hughes).  
 o Removed hardcoding of location of help documents.  Here's how things
   work now: By default, the www.ncsa.uiuc.edu location is used.  This can be
   overridden in src/Makefile by setting the DOCS_DIRECTORY_DEFAULT
   define.  This can in turn be overridden by the environment variable
   MOSAIC_DOCS_DIRECTORY environment variable, which can in turn be
   overridden by the XMosaic*DocsDirectory X resource (which by default is
   NULL).  How's that?  
 o Home page is now customizable at compile time by setting
   -DHOME_PAGE_DEFAULT to any URL.  
 o Other things that are customizable at compile time (see src/mosaic.h): 
    o WHATSNEW_PAGE_DEFAULT 
    o DEMO_PAGE_DEFAULT 
    o HTMLPRIMER_PAGE_DEFAULT 
    o URLPRIMER_PAGE_DEFAULT 
 o Removed native DMF support.  
 o Reading a .HDF file that's not an HDF/netCDF file no longer exits on
   "ncopen: Not a netcdf file".  

From 1.2 to 2.0 prerelease 0
............................

 o Native HDF browsing support, and resources to support it.  
 o Search keyword is now in a dialog box.  
 o Mouse tracking, including display of target URL.  
 o Bitmaps in Gopher interface.  
 o History list now tracks jumps to internal anchors.  
 o New and improved PostScript printing (courtesy Ameet Raval and Frans Von
   Hoesel); see below.  
 o Usenet news reading problems and other bugs fixed.  
 o DTM support updated to Collage 1.2-alpha equivalent.  

From 1.1 to 1.2
...............

 o Binary transfer mode, when on, now forces all files to be treated as
   binary, whether or not their extensions are recognized.  (Due to
   overwhelming popular request.) 
 o Gopher file types are now picked up on the basis of file extension, if a
   file extension exists, with the default being the normally assumed
   type.  This means that "foo.ps" returned as type '0' (text) is interpreted
   as PostScript, etc.  Resource tweakGopherTypes (default True) can be
   set to False to turn this off and interpret Gopher documents stricly by
   the Gopher typing system.  
 o Resource postscriptViewerCommand is now "dump" by default.  This
   is because ghostview (the previous default), as currently shipped, runs
   ghostscript in unsafe mode and a malicious PostScript file could cause
   damage to your filesystem as a result.  
 o Added fullHostname resource to allow explicit setting of the fully
   qualified hostname (machine.domain).  We recommend you don't use
   this resource (allow Mosaic to determine your full hostname on the
   fly) unless your system chokes on gethostbyname().  
 o Fixed problem with annotationServer resource set and annotation
   server not available or network down.  
 o Fixed problem with missing title (or author) in annotation.  
 o Fixed occasional coredump in File->Reload.  
 o Fixed occasional crash with inlined images after windows have been
   closed.  
 o Made failure of gethostbyname() robust (coredumps actually inside
   gethostbyname() must still be dealt with by the gethostbynameIsEvil
   resource).  
 o Fixed coredump when checking for editable annotation property when
   document contains no text.  
 o Fixed coredump when closing window if hotkey is hit while window
   is still open but in the process of being destroyed.  
 o Local files should now always be automatically canonicalized into a
   full URL of form file://hostname/full/path/filename -- this applies to
   command-line arguments and to filenames passed through
   File->Open.
 o Now recognize file://localhost/ scheme for expressly accessing local
   files.  
 o Fixed problem with multiline FTP server responses (courtesy John
   Ockerbloom).  
 o Fixed problem with ".." in FTP directory resulting in slash falling off
   of toplevel URL and subsequent jumps failing.  
 o Fixed problem with trailing slashes in FTP directory specifications
   that were causing part of the directory name to be used twice.  
 o Changed sgimoviePlayerCommand default to movieplayer, which
   actually exists on some SGI systems.  
 o Made a few changes to menubar Documents and Help menus.  
 o Cleaned up lots of typecasting warnings in Xmx code.  
 o Fixed problem with Motif 1.2 and file insertions in annotate window.  
 o Fixed problem with double quotes in titles of group annotations.  
 o Added resource reverseInlinedBitmapColors to allow reversal of
   foreground and background colors in inlined XBM bitmaps.  
 o Fixed problem with group annotations on URL's containing pound
   signs (normally this never happens, but it will happen for HDF files in
   Mosaic 2.0).  
 o Added confirmation box for deleting annotations from the menubar;
   added resource confirmDeleteAnnotation, defaults to true.  
 o Correctly recognizes mis-suffixed HTML files starting with <head>,
   <html>, and <HTML> tags also now.  
 o XPM3-format inlined image support fixed.  

From 1.0 to 1.1
...............

 o Hotkeys in document view windows.  
 o Color leaks and glitches in inlined image support fixed.  
 o Support for TMPDIR environment variable, as well as resource 
   tmpDirectory and command-line flag -tmpdir, for specifying
   location of tmp directory for transient data files.  
 o Added GUI-supported modification of hotlist entry titles.  
 o Added ISMAP tag support to IMG tag (courtesy Tony Sanders).  
 o CSO phonebook support (courtesy Lou Montulli).  
 o Added printing/saving straight to PostScript (courtesy Ameet A.  Raval).
   No support for images yet, though.  
 o Fixed typo in Motif 1.2 support in HTML widget.  
 o Fixed typo (nothing was broken, just caused it to be a little slow
   sometimes) in document page handling.  
 o Two spaces between sentences in pretty selections now.  
 o SGML comments are now ignored.  
 o Updated copyright notice.  
 o Documentation hyperlinks point straight to new NCSA server.  
 o Mosaic can now be remotely controlled via signals by a parent process;
   e.g., to allow use as a browser for context-sensitive help from another
   application.  More information coming...  
 o Default rgbViewerCommand is now 'xv' on non-SGI platforms, since xv
   3.0 now handles SGI RGB files.  
 o New WAIS interface document, pointing to NCSA gateway.  
 o URL of document is now sent in 'Mail To...' messages.  
 o <cite> now supported.  
 o <blockquote> now supported.  
 o <var> now uses italics.  
 o Fixed rare parsing/layout coredumps.  
 o Fixed rare pretty selection coredumps.  
 o Fixed stupid memory and file-handling glitches; made hotlist and other
   config file-handling much more robust.  
 o Properly handle (nuke) newlines in titles and URL's now.  
 o Fixed rare stupid coredumps in Motif lists.  
 o No more coredump when saving/printing/mailing empty file.  
 o Mosaic now has no default geometry resource value.  Initial window
   placement and toplevel dialog placement will be entirely according to
   your window manager's settings.  
 o Added resource percentVerticalSpace to allow customization of the space
   between paragraphs, between headers and paragraphs, etc.  in the HTML
   widget.  
 o Fixed coredump when starting Mosaic with home page a directory with
   no slashes in the specification.  
 o Added recognition of '.gz' for gzip'd files, as per GNU change.  
 o Fixed glitch with X bitmaps served by Gopher servers as inlined images.  
 o Added editres support.  
 o Added Motif 1.2 tearoff menu support.  
 o Better DEC Alpha OSF/1 support.  
 o Better Dell SVR4 support.  
 o A few more source cleanups for NeXT support.  
 o Reorganized Documents menu and added new options to Help menu.  
 o Added support for group annotation server (not yet available).  
 o Cleaned up src/Makefile (some).  
 o Suffixes .dump and .saveme are now recognized and trigger binary
   file dump to local disk.  
 o Busy cursor now shows up more often, like it should.  
 o HDF files are now recognized and passed to Collage via Collage's -load
   option, which isn't yet in a released version.  
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.  

From 0.13 to 1.0
................

 o Added new resource, gethostbynameIsEvil, for Sun's that
   coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what
   their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) 
 o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view
   window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so
   themselves. 
 o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. 
 o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. 
 o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient
   cut-n-paste entries of URL's. 
 o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document
   view windows will not be automatically positioned by the
   program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how
   they're placed). 
 o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new
   resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). 
 o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. 
 o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. 
 o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read
   (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not
   right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images
   in any case). 
 o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A
   HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. 
 o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. 
 o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. 
 o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's. 
 o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy
   dana@thumper.bellcore.com). 
 o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy
   johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com). 
 o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk). 
 o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy
   bingle@cs.purdue.edu). 
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. 

From 0.12 to 0.13
.................

 o Fixed occasional mysterious coredump in startup routines. 
 o Fixed occasional stupid coredump in freeing document text. 
 o Fixed silly coredump on accessing malformed URLs like
   ftp:/tcp/xxx.yyy.zzz.www. 
 o Fixed URL parsing choke on accessing URL 'test.html#foobar' as
   an initial program argument. 
 o Added system() call error reporting. 
 o Changed default anchor representations: blue and single solid
   underline for unvisited, dark purple and single dashed underline
   for visited. 
 o Jumping from 2nd+ document page to 1st document page in a
   single document via anchors works now. 
 o Various glitches with scrollbars, document pages, etc. fixed. 
 o New toggle-button options (caseless, backwards) in File->Search
   window. 
 o File->Search doesn't put search results on top line of window. 
 o Use of -l flag for rlogins restored. 
 o Built-in finger interface with faces support (thanks, Marc V of
   IU!). 
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. 

From 0.11 to 0.12
.................

 o Files retrieved via binary transfer mode now get a file selection box
   for user-provided filename. 
 o Inlined image widths are now taken into account when formatting
   text & images together. 
 o Fixed trigger of server bug on some systems wrt freeing color cells. 
 o Inlined images work on 24-bit TrueColor servers now. 
 o GUI interface for mailing hotlist and window history lists. 
 o Support for <ol> (numbered lists). 
 o Better support for nested description lists. 
 o Support for <tt>, <b>, <i>, <em>, <strong>, <code>, <samp>,
   <kbd>, <var>, and corresponding resources italicFont, boldFont, and
   fixedFont. 
 o Better 8-bit cleanliness. 
 o Bug with inlined images as anchors at end of documents fixed. 
 o Compact description lists: <dl compact> causes first line of <dd>
   text to jump up on same line with <dt> if room exists. 
 o SGML representations of 8-bit ISO8859 characters now work. 
 o Fixed bugs with weird Lucida font metrics on DEC Alpha and a few
   other servers. 
 o Fixed coredump triggered by <li>'s outside of a list. 
 o Fixed coredumps on malformed URL's like telnet:machine.name. 
 o Fixed coredumps on malformed URL's like
   gopher:/gopher.uiuc.edu/. 
 o Various document types returned via WAIS searches are now
   detected (by extension only) and forked to viewers as appropriate. 
 o Fixed minor bug with disappearing whitespace. 
 o Fixed bug with extraneous newlines in description lists in very
   narrow windows. 
 o Fixed bug with erroneous description elements causing text to fall
   off the left side of the screen. 
 o Audio annotations on HP systems with audio hardware work now. 
 o Default SGI audio annotation quality is lower now, to decrease disk
   space usage. 
 o SCO Open Desktop support. 
 o Harris Nighthawk support. 
 o AIX 3.2 support for reading local directories. 
 o Minor bugfixes and cleanups. 

From 0.10 to 0.11
.................

 o Bug fix for non-SGI X servers: bitmaps now show up with
   correct (normal foreground and background) colors.
 o Bug fix for Ultrix: no more meaningless coredumps when
   closing windows.

From 0.9 to 0.10
................

 o Support for <IMG> tag: inlined images in HTML documents.
    o Handles X bitmap and GIF formats so far.
    o New resource, colorsPerInlinedImage, can be used to restrict
      color use of inlined images -- default is 50.
    o Image files can be located anywhere on the net (pointed to by
      URL); image data is cached in memory for fast display and
      reuse.
    o Example of inlined bitmap: 
      <IMG SRC="file://foobar.com/foobar.xbm">
    o Example of inlined image serving as anchor: 
      <A HREF="http://foobar.com/ref.html"> 
      <IMG SRC="file://foobar.com/blagh.gif"> </A>
 o Better support for acting as binary file retrieval client.
    o Each window can either be in binary transfer mode or not;
      resource binaryTransferMode controls startup value (default
      is 'False', and you probably don't want to change this). A
      toggle button in the Options menu allows changing on the fly.
    o If a window is not in binary trasfer mode, data files with
      unrecognized types will be displayed in the window as either
      plain text or HTML (depending on the server type), as before.
    o If a window is in binary transfer mode, data files with
      unrecognized types will be dumped to a local file after being
      transferred over as binary data.
    o Regardless of whether a window is in binary transfer mode or
      not, files with recognizes types (images, sound, etc.) will be
      handled as usual, and uncompression will be transparent as
      usual.
    o The whole point of all this is to allow the user to select on the
      fly how a given file of an unrecognized type is to be handled.
    o Because files are currently typed by filename extension,
      binary transfer mode should generally be kept off, otherwise
      it will screw up things like WAIS searches pretty badly. Also,
      since Gopher does things differently from everyone else,
      things are different there too.
    o Setting one of the multimedia resources to the text string
      "dump" will cause files of that type to be dumped to local
      disk as though in binary transfer mode.
    o See http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/mosaic-docs/file-typing-issues.html 
      for a more thorough discussion of these issues.
 o Audio annotations for Sun's with /usr/demo/SOUND/record (or
   something similar) are now enabled. Resources
   recordCommandLocation and recordCommand are used to specify the
   command used to record sound; theoretically, this approach can be
   used on any platform with appropriate hardware and software,
   although SGI Indigo & Sun Sparcstation are the only two that I know
   of.
 o Search capability within documents: enter search term, scrollbar
   jumps to match and match is highlighted; repeat as desired.
 o Enhanced support for various Gopher types, including binary files
   and CSO phonebooks (sorry, phonebooks aren't supported yet, but at
   least now an error message shows up).
 o Spaces converted to +'s in keyword queries now.
 o Scrollbar arrows now increment a reasonable amount when viewing
   large documents.
 o Anonymous FTP password is now always user@host.domain,
   enabling access to every strange FTP server out there that I know of.
 o Pattern-matching to determine file type based on file name now uses
   caseless string compare.
 o Better default visited anchor color for non-SGI color displays.
 o Messages from libwww now show up in pop-up dialogs like they
   should.
 o Telnet never gets asked to use unrecognized -l flag.
 o Tar files are now always retrieved to local disk (and not displayed).
 o Replacement (and better) Archie interface.
 o Mail Developers window is cleared on each use.
 o New resource trackVisitedAnchors; can be used to turn off tracking
   of visited anchors altogether.
 o Better transparent uncompression support:
    o Gzipped (.z) files are now recognized and uncompressed on
      the fly (as well as .Z files, as before).
    o New resources uncompressCommand (default 'uncompress')
      and gunzipCommand (default 'gunzip').
 o As usual, little bugfixes and cleanups.

From 0.8 to 0.9
...............

 o Some multimedia support. Yew asked for it...
    o GIF, JPEG, TIFF, audio, AIFF, DVI, MPEG, MIME, XWD,
      PostScript automatically recognized.
    o Pipe to external viewers (with viewers set via X resource
      mechanism).
    o Also retrieve images, audio over Gopher.
    o But not over HTTP (unless you're running a modified HTTP
      server).
    o Inlined MIME/multimedia support will be coming down the
      road, so this is all just a temporary hack.
 o Transparent handling of compressed (.Z) files.
 o Hotlist now *always* saved after modification.
 o Fixed occasional infinite loop/crash for some 8-bit documents.
 o Fixed various parsing bugs associated with using <xmp> instead of
   <plaintext> internally.

 o Fixed bug with spurious ^M's in Gopher anchors.
 o Fixed bug opening local file while visiting remote file.
 o Fixed display bug with punctuation falling off end of line.
 o Fixed problem with BadAlloc crashes on some servers.
 o Annotation text features.
    o Choice of annotation links in header or footer.
    o Automatic (& fast) updating of annotations on every
      document view.
    o New defaultAuthorName resource to override use of normal
      fullname.
    o Annotations now always use machine's full name.
 o Menubar item 'Delete This Annotation'.
 o Audio annotations (SGI only, so far).
 o Fixed BadWindow bug for annotation window on DECstations.
 o All plaintext files can now be annotated.
 o Fixed occasional problem with size of hotlist/history windows.
 o Added sample app-defaults files to distribution.
 o New resources for multimedia stuff:
    o gifViewerCommand (default 'xv')
    o jpegViewerCommand (default 'xv')
    o tiffViewerCommand (default 'xv')
    o audioPlayerCommand (default 'showaudio' from Metamail
      distribution)
    o aiffPlayerCommand (default 'sfplay' -- SGI specific)
    o dviViewerCommand (default 'xdvi')
    o mpegViewerCommand (default 'mpeg_play')
    o mimeViewerCommand (default 'xterm -e metamail')
    o xwdViewerCommand (default 'xwud -in')
    o rgbViewerCommand (default 'ipaste' -- SGI specific)
    o postscriptViewerCommand
 o Deleted annotations now have all corresponding disk files removed.
 o Mosaic is smarter about the <plaintext> HTML token at the head of
   plaintext files.
 o Lots of little cleanups and bug fixes.

From 0.7 to 0.8
...............

 o Telnet access is enabled for IBM systems (and others that don't define
   'unix' by default).
 o TN3270 access is now available (probably will only work on IBM
   systems).
 o Underline setting now carries from window to window like it should.
 o Stupid little bugs nailed in open local file routines.
 o More stupid little bugs nailed in opening multiple windows.
 o Fixed buglet with text fields on some platforms.
 o Most plaintext documents can now be annotated (except for results of
   WAIS queries and those that use <plaintext> explicitly).
 o Annotate and Edit Annotation menubar entries disabled for stupid Ultrix,
   since the annotation window causes a spurious BadWindow error for no
   apparent reason at all.
 o Better colors (including brighter colors on non-SGI platforms).
 o Makefile option to compile with mono colors as the default.
 o Revised copyright notice.
 o A few random bugfixes and cleanups.

From 0.6 to 0.7
...............

 o Annotations!
    o Personal only (until smart servers get written).
    o Automatic inlining of annotation pointers into documents.
    o Annotations automatically persistent across sessions (naturally).
    o Annotations are subsequently editable/removable.
    o Lots of neat GUI things.
 o Underlined anchors! You're gonna love this.
    o 0, 1, 2, or 3 underlines for each of unvisited and previously
      visited anchor types.
    o Solid or dashed underlines for each of unvisited and previously
      visited anchor types.
 o Application exits when all windows are closed.
 o Support for <menu> and <dir>.
 o Better support for nested lists (filled bullets, empty bullets, 
   empty boxes).
 o Better selection capabilities:
    o Select by character.
    o New resource, fancySelections: if true, selections will be
      "pretty-printed" when pasted into a normal X window (with
      underlined headers, bullets for lists, etc.). This is modifiable
      per-window from the menubar also.
 o Additional command-line argument: free-standing URL will be used as
   home document, and overrides all other specifications (including
   WWW_HOME, X resource homeDocument, and -home flag). Is that
   enough ways to specify the home document??? :-)
 o Additional command-line flag -mono, for getting black&white fallback
   X defaults... you mono people out there are gonna have to let me know if
   I'm providing a decent set of mono resources. Should there be a
   distinction between -mono and -greyscale??
 o Middle button button in scrolled lists is now equivalent of
   double-clicking with left button.
 o Performance enhancement for history window's future list.
 o Fix for gopher connection port usage.
 o Fix for proper gopher and WAIS document titles.
 o Temporary fix to access Supreme Court documents on Cornell Law
   School server (if manager of that server is out there, please contact me --
   you have a problem).
 o Option menu for document title/url display at top of window.
 o Cute icons in upper right-hand corner of windows for quick window ID.
 o Previous search keyword is trimmed correctly.
 o Search keyword remains in text field until search is complete.

   during startup.
 o Hotlist is saved every time it's changed, to avoid losing information.
 o Busy cursor is used more often, as it should be.
 o Better handling of telnet/xterm functions (forked into background;
   browser never lands on 'telnet' document).
 o Ghostview runs in background now.
 o Changed application class name to 'XMosaic' for consistency.
 o Minor bugfixes and cleanups.

From 0.5 to 0.6
...............

History window now shows both 'where you've been' and
  'where you can go'.
Previously visited nodes are colored differently, a la Midaswww;
  this global history is automatically persistent across sessions.
New resources for customization, including:
  Show URLs instead of Document Titles.
  Customize window per document feature.
  Optionally have pointer and focus warp to keyword entry field
    when you reach a searchable node.
  Optionally turn off global history mechanism.
  Specify home document (overridden by WWW_HOME env variable).
Button2 can now activate anchors; forces a new window
  to open (as with Window Per Document feature).
Going from a document necessarily wider than the window
  (e.g. preformatted text) to a normal document will now
  get rid of the horizontal scrollbar and reformat properly.
Scrollbar and document page state is maintained so stepping
  through the history list lands you were last in each document.
Addition of Whine option under Help.
Addition of Go To and Go To Local options under Navigate.
Addition of outlet to Ghostview for PostScript documents
  (this is a hack but it's a slick demo feature).
<listing> is now recognized.
Tabs now work in preformatted/plaintext regions.
Numeric character references are now handled.
Anchors without href's aren't colored anymore.
Search Keyword field's sensitivity is managed correctly now.
SIGINT now interrupts network connections too
  (so you can hit Ctrl-C in shell window at any time).
Memory leak in document reformatting nailed.
Cloning a window is now intelligent and doesn't do a network
  reload; also, window size is maintained.
Layout glitches fixed.
Text selection glitches fixed.
Other misc bugfixes and cleanups.
Better help.
