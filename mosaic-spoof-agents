# Agent Spoofing -- Who will you be today?
#
# "I don't think [t]he[y]'ll be too keen" -- Originally from Monty Python, run
#                                            into the ground by Tommy Reilly

# NOTE! There is a hard limit of 50 agents! Mosaic will not read anymore!
#
# This file should be located in $HOME/.mosaic (or Library/Mosaic-CK) named
#   mosaic-spoof-agents
#
# This file consists of lines that begin with a # (comment), a - (a seperator
#  for the sub-menu off options), a + (this is special...it denotes that the
#  agent following it [no spaces] should be the default agent to use) and
#  anything else (considered an agent spoof line).
#
-  This is a seperator...as long as the first thing is a dash
#  This is a comment line
#
# This is the "example" agent. If you don't like it...comment it out.
#   if you want it to be your default, put a + infront of it.
