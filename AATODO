System
------
Get mousewheel working (see http://colas.nahaboo.net/mouse-wheel-scroll/ )
Fix and reenable SOCKS
Should be able to scroll and interact while things are loading.
SSL
Embed Perl interpreter (test back to 5.004; see perlembed)
	there must be an option to not compile with it, too.
Cookies

Alternative renderer
--------------------
Widget redraw needs work.

Expand UTF-8 table

<nobr>

Support bgcolor (secretly for any block-level element, including
<div> and <td>)

<font color>
<font size>

Frames should render as <a href=> a la Lynx

Read through the delayed image code, figure out how to build a list
of style sheets (including this document if it has <style>), and then
hold on to them OR better still integrate them into the document itself

Once Perl is embedded, write code to translate CSS into block level code.
Make an option to turn it on and off.

Interface
---------
Scroll to an anchor/fragment
